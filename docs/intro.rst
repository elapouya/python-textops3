To install::

    pip install python-textops3

Quickstart
----------

The usual way to use textops is something like below. IMPORTANT : Note that textops library redefines
the python **bitwise OR** operator ``|`` in order to use it as a 'pipe' like in a Unix shell::

   from textops import *

   result = "an input text" | my().chained().operations()

   or

   for result_item in "an input text" | my().chained().operations():
      do_something(result_item)

   or

   myops = my().chained().operations()
   # and later in the code, use them :
   result = myops("an input text")
   or
   result = "an input text" |Â myops

An "input text" can be :

   * a simple string,
   * a multi-line string (one string having newlines),
   * a list of strings,
   * a strings generator,
   * a list of lists (useful when you cut lines into columns),
   * a list of dicts (useful when you parse a line).

So one can do::

   >>> 'line1line2line3' | grep('2').tolist()
   ['line1line2line3']
   >>> 'line1\nline2\nline3' | grep('2').tolist()
   ['line2']
   >>> ['line1','line2','line3'] | grep('2').tolist()
   ['line2']
   >>> [['line','1'],['line','2'],['line','3']] | grep('2').tolist()
   [['line', '2']]
   >>> [{'line':1},{'line':'2'},{'line':3}] | grep('2').tolist()
   [{'line': '2'}]

.. note::

   As many operations return a generator, they can be used directly in for-loops, but in this
   documentation we added ``.tolist()`` to show the result as a list.

Textops library also redefines ``>>`` operator that works like the ``|`` except that it converts
generators results into lists::

   >>> 'a\nb' | grep('a')                                # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
   <generator object extend_type_gen at ...>
   >>> 'a\nb' | grep('a').tolist()
   ['a']
   >>> 'a\nb' >> grep('a')
   ['a']
   >>> for line in 'a\nb' | grep('a'):
   ...     print(line)
   a
   >>> 'abc' | length()
   3
   >>> 'abc' >> length()
   3

.. note::

   You should use the pipe ``|`` when you are expecting a huge result or when using for-loops,
   otherwise, the ``>>`` operator is easier to handle as you are not keeping generators.

Here is an example of chained operations to find the first line with an error and put it in uppercase::

   >>> from textops import *
   >>> myops = grepi('error').first().upper()

.. note::

   str standard methods (like 'upper') can be used directly in chained dotted notation.

You can use unix shell 'pipe' symbol into python code to chain operations::

   >>> from textops import *
   >>> myops = grepi('error') | first() | strop.upper()

If you do not want to import all textops operations, you can only import textops as ``op``::

   >>> import textops as op
   >>> myops = op.grepi('error') | op.first() | op.strop.upper()

.. note::

   str methods must be prefixed with ``strop.`` in piped notations.

Chained operations are not executed (lazy object) until an input text has been provided. You can
use chained operations like a function, or use the pipe symbol to "stream" input text::

   >>> myops = grepi('error').first().upper()
   >>> print(myops('this is an error\nthis is a warning'))
   THIS IS AN ERROR
   >>> print('this is an error\nthis is a warning' | myops)
   THIS IS AN ERROR

.. note::

   python generators are used as far as possible to be able to manage huge data set like big files.
   Prefer to use the dotted notation, it is more optimized.

To execute operations at once, specify the input text in parenthesis after chained operation as they were a function::

   >>> print(grepi('error').first().upper()('this is an error\nthis is a warning'))
   THIS IS AN ERROR

A more readable way is to use ONE pipe symbol, then use dotted notation for other operations :
this is the **recommended way to use textops**. Because of the first pipe, there is no need to use
special textops Extended types, you can use standard strings or lists as an input text::

   >>> print('this is an error\nthis is a warning' | grepi('error').first().upper())
   THIS IS AN ERROR

You could use the pipe everywhere (internally a little less optimized, but looks like shell)::

   >>> print('this is an error\nthis is a warning' | grepi('error') | first() | strop.upper())
   THIS IS AN ERROR

To execute an operation directly from strings, lists or dicts *with the dotted notation*,
you must use textops Extended types : ``StrExt``, ``ListExt`` or ``DictExt``::

   >>> s = StrExt('this is an error\nthis is a warning')
   >>> print(s.grepi('error').first().upper())
   THIS IS AN ERROR

.. note::

   As soon as you are using textops Extended type, textops cannot use gnerators internally anymore :
   all data must fit into memory (it is usually the case, so it is not a real problem).

You can use the operations result in a 'for' loop::

   >>> open('/tmp/errors.log','w').write('error 1\nwarning 1\nwarning 2\nerror 2')
   35
   >>> for line in '/tmp/errors.log' | cat().grepi('warning').head(1).upper():
   ...   print(line)
   WARNING 1

A shortcut is possible : the input text can be put as the first parameter of the first operation.
nevertheless, in this case, despite the input text is provided, chained operations won't be executed
until used in a for-loop, converted into a string/list or forced by special attributes::

   # Just creating a test file here :
   >>> open('/tmp/errors.log','w').write('error 1\nwarning 1\nwarning 2\nerror 2')
   35

   # Here, operations are excuted because 'print' converts into string :
   # it triggers execution.
   >>> print(cat('/tmp/errors.log').grepi('warning').head(1).upper())
   WARNING 1

   # Here, operations are excuted because for-loops or list casting triggers execution.
   >>> for line in cat('/tmp/errors.log').grepi('warning').head(1).upper():
   ...   print(line)
   WARNING 1

   # Here, operations are NOT executed because there is no for-loops nor string/list cast :
   # operations are considered as a lazy object, that is the reason why
   # only the object representation is returned (chained operations in dotted notation)
   >>> logs = cat('/tmp/errors.log')
   >>> logs                            # the cat() is not executed, you see only its python representation :
   cat('/tmp/errors.log')
   >>> print(type(logs))
   <class 'textops.ops.fileops.cat'>

   # To force execution, use special attribute .s .l or .g :
   >>> open('/tmp/errors.log','w').write('error 1\nwarning 1')
   17
   >>> logs = cat('/tmp/errors.log').s  # '.s' to execute operations and get a string (StrExt)
   >>> print(type(logs)                 )# you get a textops extended string
   <class 'textops.base.StrExt'>
   >>> print(logs)
   error 1
   warning 1

   >>> logs = cat('/tmp/errors.log').l  # '.l' to execute operations and get a list (ListExt)
   >>> print(type(logs))
   <class 'textops.base.ListExt'>
   >>> print(logs)
   ['error 1', 'warning 1']

   >>> logs = cat('/tmp/errors.log').g  # '.g' to execute operations and get a generator
   >>> print(type(logs))
   <class 'generator'>
   >>> print(list(logs))
   ['error 1', 'warning 1']

.. note::

   | ``.s`` : execute operations and get a string
   | ``.l`` : execute operations and get a list of strings
   | ``.g`` : execute operations and get a generator of strings

your input text can be a list::

   >>> print(['this is an error','this is a warning'] | grepi('error').first().upper())
   THIS IS AN ERROR

textops works also on list of lists (you can optionally grep on a specific column)::

   >>> l = ListExt([['this is an','error'],['this is a','warning']])
   >>> print(l.grepi('error',1).first().upper())
   ['THIS IS AN', 'ERROR']

... or a list of dicts (you can optionally grep on a specific key)::

   >>> l = ListExt([{ 'msg':'this is an', 'level':'error'},
   ... {'msg':'this is a','level':'warning'}])
   >>> print(l.grepi('error','level').first())
   {'msg': 'this is an', 'level': 'error'}

textops provides DictExt class that has got the attribute access functionnality::

   >>> d = DictExt({ 'a' : { 'b' : 'this is an error\nthis is a warning'}})
   >>> print(d.a.b.grepi('error').first().upper())
   THIS IS AN ERROR

If attributes are reserved or contains space, one can use normal form::

   >>> d = DictExt({ 'this' : { 'is' : { 'a' : {'very deep' : { 'dict' : 'yes it is'}}}}})
   >>> print(d.this['is'].a['very deep'].dict)
   yes it is

You can use dotted notation for setting information in dict BUT only on one level at a time::

   >>> d = DictExt()
   >>> d.a = DictExt()
   >>> d.a.b = 'this is my logging data'
   >>> print(d)
   {'a': {'b': 'this is my logging data'}}

You saw ``cat``, ``grep``, ``first``, ``head`` and ``upper``, but there are many more operations available.
